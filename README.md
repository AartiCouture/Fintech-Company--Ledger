Homework 1 - Case Study Ledger

Ledger

* Ledger was founded in 2014 by 8 experts with complementary backgrounds in cybersecurity, cryptocurrencies,  and entrepreneurship.  These 8 individuals came to work together to create Ledger with a desire to create secure solutions for blockchain apps. The 4 main founders are Eric LarchevÃªque, Joel Pobeda, Nicolas Bacca, Thomas France.


* Ledger started off with a grant in Paris, France with a total funding amount of 1,400,000 Euros in September 2015.  In March 2017, it recieved a round of Series A funding for $7,000,000.  Following that, Ledger received $75,000,000 in Series B funding.  In April 2019, Ledger recieved $2,900,000 in funding in a venture round, Series unknown.  Finally, Ledger recieveed $380,000,000 in Series C funding, in June 2021.  In total, Ledger has had 8 funding rounds with a total funding amount of $468,000,000.


## Business Activities:

* Ledger is trying to solve the problem of digital currency and blochchain application security. They also provide security to businesses such as exchanges like Voyager through Ledger Vault.  

* Ledger's intended customers are individual digital currency holders and businesses such as cryptocurrency exchanges like Voyager or Coinbase. The market size for hardware wallets in 2020 was $699.6 million dollars and is projected to grow to 58 billion 290 million dollars. Anyone that needs to secure their digital currency and assets is a potential Ledger customer. 

* Ledger uses a proprietary technology to provide security for cryptocurrencies and exchanges. 

* Ledger developed a unique operating system (OS) called BOLOS, which they integrate either to a secure chip for their Ledger wallet line, or to a Hardware Security Module (HSM) for various business solutions. As of now, Ledger has been the only company in the market to provide this technology.


## Landscape:

* Ledger is in the Cybersecurity/Financial Technology industry.

* Hardware wallets have become more sophisticated in the last 10 years, with companies like Ledger developing prorietary technology to secure larger amounts of assets.  There are newer companies entering the market, such as Securx, which are bringing vaukt level security straight to the hands of customers at any level, from retail to business. 

* Terzor, Ellipal, Electrum, Exodus, Mycelium are some of the top competitiors for Ledger.


## Results

* Ledger has created a new way to secure a relatively new form of currency. As businesses move towards blockchain transactions, Ledger has provided an easy and convenient way to secure these transactions. 

* Security, relaibility and usability are the key metrics for companies like Ledger. Ledger was considered the gold standard until it was hacked in 2020, revealing personal information about its customers and making them the target of elaborate phishing schemes.  Ledger updated its security and is back at the top, but the hack has tarnished its reputation. 

* Ledger Nano S was considered to be the best in industry for beginners to experts, until the 2020 hack, dropping it to number 2 behind Trezor.  While Ledger has updated its security, it was unable to regain the top spot in this industry after the breach.


## Recommendations

* Ledger Nano X does not provide a touchscreen as of yet, compared to its top competitior, Trezor.  I would suggest adding a touchscreen for ease of use and a more modern design.  I would also recommend that Ledger consistently update their security to make sure that they do not have another security breach.  

* For new or retail investors, ease of use is key. adding a touchscreen offers this. Building back trust with consistent updates is key after the security breach.

* This new product would require a new display for Ledger's wallet line as well as security updates for Ledger Live.

* This will modernize Ledger to compete for customers with Trezor.  It will also broaden its market by including newer, less tech savvy investors.
